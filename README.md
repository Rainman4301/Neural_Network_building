# ðŸ§  Neural_Network_building

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This repository serves as a hands-on guide to building foundational neural network architectures from scratch. The goal is to solidify understanding of how neural networks work internally by implementing key components without relying heavily on high-level libraries.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
To deepen theoretical and practical understanding of neural networks by manually constructing the following models:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Perceptron** â€“ A fundamental building block of neural networks.
- ðŸ”µ **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** â€“ For image-based pattern recognition.
- ðŸ”´ **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** â€“ For processing sequential data such as time series or language.

## ðŸ§± Architecture Breakdown

1. **Perceptron**
   - Implements single-layer and multi-layer perceptrons.
   - Activation functions, forward propagation, and weight updates.

2. **CNN**
   - Custom implementation of convolutional layers, pooling, and flattening.
   - Basic image classification experiments.

3. **RNN**
   - Simple recurrent architecture to handle sequences.
   - Time-step processing and backpropagation through time (BPTT).
